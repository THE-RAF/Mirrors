Perhaps do differently:
- total separation of concerns between graphics, data and functionality
- use functional programming and state management instead of OOP (state machines?)
- create standalone isolated smaller apps for different concepts (like single-order reflections, infinite reflections, orthogonal reflections, etc.)

I learned:
- using LLMs to create design md files helps a lot, and I'm beginning to use this more and more
- LLM created md files help a lot, perhaps I can create a new architecture to keep them on the codebase
- I only managed to complete this because I already knew what the AI was going to do and validated immediately by seeing it
- For upcoming projects I want to create custom instructions for Copilot and crreate a paradigm that automatically ensures the default architecture, so I can use high level instructions to create the entire codebase easily, without sacrificing high quality code
